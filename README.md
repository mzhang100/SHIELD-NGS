# SHIELD-NGS
Description of NGS data analysis
1. We used the Biocluster server (https://help.igb.illinois.edu/Biocluster) provided by the Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) for NGS data processing and analysis. NGS data files were transferred to the Biocluster using Cybeduck.
2. We used the FASTX-TOOLKIT module available at Biocluster for file conversion (i.e., fastq to fasta) and reads trimming.
3. We used the BLAST+ module available at Biocluster for the alignment of NGS reads to library sequences. To do this, we first created a BLAST database consisting of 1000 designed library elements.
